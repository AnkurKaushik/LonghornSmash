                Longhorn Smash began as a grassroots club among a small group of UT students who wanted people to play Smash with. Throughout the years, it has evolved into something bigger than its parts,
                growing in membership and activity. Our Discord server has over 500 members and alumni. We host weekly tournaments that are open to all skill levels of players, encouraging UT students to get a taste
                of the competitive scene.

                Starting in 2020, Longhorn Smash introduced guilds to the community. Top players in the group led each guild, and each guild competed to earn points in the Discord.
                While the guild system is constantly evolving, one thing has stayed true: the guild system encourages friendly competition and banter among our memebers. It offers new members a way to make friends in the communituy and welcome to the scene.
                From practice sessions to hangouts ranging from Boba meetups to escape rooms to PCL study sessions, our community joins members together through smash and fun.
